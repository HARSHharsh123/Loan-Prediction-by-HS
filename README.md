## A new Approach for Loan Prediction using Machine Learning (Using Concepts of Pipelines and Columns Transformers)

(Additional Info : This project is Selected as one of the best project in my institue.)

## Problem Statement 
Banks are making major part of profits through loans. Though lot of people are applying for loans. Itâ€™s hard to select the genuine applicant who will repay the loan. While doing the process manually , Lot of misconception may happen to select the genuine applicant. Therefore , Our Aim is to develop a solution that will automatically selects the eligible candidates on the basis of some features.  This is helpful to both bank staff and applicant by streamlining the process and ensuring fair selection.


## Loan Approval Prediction System
This project is a web application built using Streamlit for predicting loan approval status based on various applicant features. It utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model to provide instant predictions.

## Features
1. Input Features: Users can input various applicant details such as number of dependents, education level, annual income, loan amount, loan term, credit score, and asset values.

2. Prediction: Upon clicking the "Predict" button, the system predicts whether the loan application will be approved or rejected.

3. Interpretability: The system also provides insights into the prediction by displaying the top features contributing to the decision.

## Technologies Used

1. Streamlit: Used for building the web application interface.
   
2. Pandas: Utilized for data manipulation and preprocessing.
   
3. XGBoost: Employed for the machine learning model for loan approval prediction.
   
4. Matplotlib: Used for visualizing feature importance.
   
5. Pipelines and Column Transformers : Auto Machine Learning and Feature Engineering
   
## Usage

 To run the application locally:

Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the application using streamlit run app.py.

## Model Training
The machine learning model used in this project was trained on a dataset containing historical loan application data. The model was trained to predict loan approval status based on various applicant features.
